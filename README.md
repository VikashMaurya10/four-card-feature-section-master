By taking this challenge i more familiar with Flex Box properties.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
main {
  .card-container {
    .cards {
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      flex-direction: row;

      &__card2 {
        order: 3;
        flex-direction: row;
      }

      &__card3 {
        order: 2;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
